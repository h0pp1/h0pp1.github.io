I needed to test the local web application. As usual, I was going to use Burpsuite but localhost traffic didn't intercepted. 
So I googled about this. It was take little much time to find out than i thought. (Firefox blah blah... I'm not big fan of it. <b>I'm using Chrome + SwitchyOmega(chrome extension)</b>)    

Anyway, If you need to capture local traffic, Add a new entry in `/etc/hosts` file with a new hostname pointing to `127.0.0.1`. I added `lokalhost` for hostname. Like this:  
```plaintext
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.0.1   lokalhost

...

```
{: file='/etc/hosts'}
<br/>

If the settings for the proxy have been set up properly, intercepting will work.
