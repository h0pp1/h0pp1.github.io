Looking back on this year, well... pretty good.
This is my best. (Why? my expression so bad.)  

Whenever at the end of the year, just repeating `"time flies"`. Personally, I think 'Time is so fast' == 'busy' so I think that the more I felt that way, the more meaningful it was in my own ways.  
This year, I have been America for the first time and I finally took off braces, graduated, and had a nice work expreience with good peoples. Of course, it wasn't always good, but I think it was a year when there were more special things.  

Anyway, I hope that it's full of good things including people around me in upcoming year.
My new year's plan is just always do my best. ðŸ™ƒ
